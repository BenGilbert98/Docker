# Containerisation with Docker

## What is Docker
- Docker is an open source platform **Docker hub documentation**
- It helps and enables us to separate applications from the infrastructure
- It allows us to deliver software faster and is lightweight 
- Docker is written in GO language
  
### Why Docker
- Multi billion dollar companies are using or adopting Docker i.e Ebay, Netflix, Sky
- Docker adoption is anticipated to be 50% by the end of 2020

### Difference between VM and Docker
- Docker is light weight and user friendly
- Docker shares the resource of OS as opposed to using the OS completely
- Docker engine connects the container with OS and only uses the resources required
